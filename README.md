This repository contains a microservice called TaskProject, which can be run using a `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) <!-- TamaÃ±o normal -->

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/siiluis007/TaskProject.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

```bash
cd TaskProject
 ```
3. Configure the environment variables by creating a .env file in the root of the repository. You can use the provided .env.example file as a template and replace the values with your own.
4. Run the docker-compose command to build and run the microservice:
```bash
docker-compose up
 ```
This will build and start the necessary containers for the microservice.

5. Once the containers have been successfully started, you can access the microservice at http://localhost:port, where port is the port configured in the docker-compose.yml file.

## Configuration
You can configure the microservice by creating and editing the .env file in the root of the repository. This file contains the necessary environment variables for the microservice. To configure the microservice, follow these steps:
1. Create a new file in the root of the repository and name it .env
2. Open the .env file in a text editor.
3. Adjust the values of the environment variables according to your needs.
4. Save the changes to the .env file.

Make sure to set the appropriate values for the variables to ensure the microservice functions correctly. Once you have configured the .env file, the microservice will utilize these environment variables during execution.
